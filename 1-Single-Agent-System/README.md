# Single Agent Systems

This folder contains various implementations of single-agent systems, showcasing different capabilities and functionalities. Each script demonstrates a unique aspect of single-agent systems, ranging from basic setups to advanced configurations with tools, memory, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Contents

1. **[1.1-basic-single-agent.py](1.1-basic-single-agent.py)**  
   A basic implementation of a single-agent system with just a persona.

2. **[1.2-single-agent-with-tools.py](1.2-single-agent-with-tools.py)**  
   Demonstrates a single agent equipped with tools for enhanced functionality.

3. **[1.3-single-agent-team.py](1.3-single-agent-team.py)**  
   Implements a single agent that can execute with self-looping.

4. **[1.4-single-agent-team-with-memory.py](1.4-single-agent-team-with-memory.py)**  
   Adds memory capabilities to the single-agent team for better context retention.

5. **[1.5-single-agent-team-with-RAG.py](1.5-single-agent-team-with-RAG.py)**  
   Integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the single-agent team for improved information retrieval and generation.
